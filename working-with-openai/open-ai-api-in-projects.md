# Using the OpenAI API

## Goals

Now that we know a bit about the OpenAI endpoints, lets learn how to use them within our programs. To do so will work with a partially finished API that creates video game NPCs (Non Playable Characters). Within that program, we will install the OpenAI library and then leverage one of OpenAI's endpoints to generate dialogue for characters we create.

Our goals for this lesson are to:
- Recognize different OpenAI endpoints and how they are used
- Understand how to integrate the OpenAI library into a python project.
- Use the OpenAI chat completion endpoint to generate content for our project.
