# Problem Set: Using GitHub's Copilot

## Wave 2 of the `mastermind-copilot` Repo

This problem set uses the `mastermind-copilot` repo, which we saw in the "Copilot in Projects" lessons.

1. If you have not yet, create a fork of [`mastermind-copilot`](https://github.com/Ada-Activities/mastermind-copilot).
2. Complete all the functions for Wave 2 described in the `mastermind-copilot` repo's [`README.md`](https://github.com/Ada-Activities/mastermind-copilot/blob/main/README.md). Practice using Copilot where it makes sense to aid your progress. 
    - As you go, it may be helpful to note what parts of the Copilot UI works best for you, what you are finding most helpful, and where you are spending your time. 
    - Remember that Copilot can be very useful, but we can also lose time if we get too invested in forcing the tool to make changes for us over manually making some changes ourselves.

There is no submission for this problem set.
