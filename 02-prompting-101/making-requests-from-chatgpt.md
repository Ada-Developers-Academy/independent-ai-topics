# Making Requests From ChatGPT

## Goals

With an idea of what LLMs are and how they’re used to create generative AI tools, we are well-equipped to dip our toes into investigating one of these tools, ChatGPT, and see how it can be of use to ourselves and others outside of programming. 

Our goals for this lesson are to:
- Get acquainted with specific uses for ChatGPT and other generative AIs outside of writing code
- Set up ChatGPT access & navigate the web interface
- Send our first prompt to ChatGPT

## Vocabulary and Synonyms

| Vocab | Definition | Synonyms | How to Use in a Sentence |
| ----- | ---------- | -------- | ------------------------ |
| Natural Language Processing | A form of artificial intelligence (AI) that focuses on the ways computers and people can interact using human language. Natural Language Processing techniques let us create tools that can analyze, understand, and respond to speech and written text, allowing us to interact with computers using natural modes of communication. | NLP | “I used Natural Language Processing techniques to analyze text from customer feedback and categorize it.” |
| Large Language Model | A type of AI algorithm that uses deep learning techniques and massively large data sets to perform a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. They work by taking an input text and repeatedly predicting the next token or word. | LLM | “Large Learning models are the type of algorithm that powers many new creative AI tools.” |
| Generative Artificial Intelligence | Generative artificial intelligence is a term for algorithms (such as ChatGPT) that can be used to create new content, such as high-quality text, images, and other content based on the data they were trained on. | Generative AI | “I asked a generative AI to create a short story about my family.” |
| Prompt | A text description of the task that an AI should perform. | | “I wrote a prompt that asks for a 5 paragraph essay on Shirley Chisholm’s accomplishments” |
| Prompt Engineering | The process of structuring text to describe tasks to be more easily processed and understood by generative AI tools.  | | “My initial prompt didn’t return what I expected, so I’m practicing a few prompt engineering techniques and rewriting my prompt to get more complete results.” |

## How are People Using AI Assistance and Generative Tools?

The readings from the Generative AI Overview lesson outlined a handful of uses for Large Language Models in the business world, but how can they help us, right now, in our own lives? We’ve listed some more use cases below with examples of how folks have used them, but there are a couple caveats to think about before we dive into our own prompting:
- Like any website with unknown sources, if an AI tool like ChatGPT is generating concrete information like dates and names that we did not provide it, we want to do our own web searches to confirm those details are accurate and not fabricated or otherwise false. We’ll dive more into techniques for verifying responses shortly.
- There are legal considerations if we use AI tools for public work or businesses. Many tools have been trained on massive data sets with text, art and other works scraped from the internet without legal clearance. Unless a tool has been built solely with data that has been given permission to be used for training and generation, it may not be legal to use the art or text generated by an AI tool verbatim, preventing us from using their responses unchanged. 

| Use Case | Example(s) or Explanation | 
| Generating ideas | Given a description of a person, get ideas for a birthday gift. Given a particular dietary restriction, create a week of meal plans.  |
| Explaining terms | If an article has a word or phrase that is difficult to look up, we can provide some of the text as context and ask for an explanation. |
| Summarizing a long text into key points  | If we have an article or long email we can ask generative AI tools to generate a short description with the highlights. |
| Categorizing sentiment from text | If we ran a website or moderated for a forum, we could ask for user feedback to be categorized to learn which areas are painful to users. |
| Formatting information | Creating a table of javascript syntax for a study guide |
| Generating quizzes for study | Given notes on a particular subject, generate 5 questions based on the notes |
| First drafts of letters or emails | Given a list of information to include, we can ask an AI tool to craft the letter, then review and customize it to our needs. |
| Reviewing text or resumes for spelling, grammar, & consistency | AI tools can be an extra set of eyes for language features like punctuation as well as consistency in how you format information across the text. |
| Generating images with specific AI tools like DALL-E, Midjourney, Photoshop’s Firefly, and more | Creating art to go with a story for a personal gift. Generating a wallpaper with handy python commands |

## Accessing ChatGPT

We're readied with some background on what generative AI tools are and how we can use them, so let's sign up for ChatGPT to get hands-on experience!



## Summary

We now have an understanding of some of the many uses for Generative AIs outside of coding, how to get set up with ChatGPT, and where to start a chat and submit prompts! This is a great time to pause and think about what questions you have on writing prompts and reflect on how you might want to use LLMs and Generative AI tools now and in the future.
